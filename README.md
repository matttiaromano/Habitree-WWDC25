# 🌱 Habitree – Gamify Your Habits, Grow Your Forest

Habitree is a beautifully designed habit-tracking app built entirely in SwiftUI, created for the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2025. It turns your daily routines into a rewarding and visual growth experience, using the metaphor of planting and growing trees to represent your progress.

At its core, Habitree is about consistency, motivation, and personal growth. Each time you complete a habit for 7 consecutive days, you grow a virtual tree. As you keep up with your habits over time, your trees multiply, forming a thriving forest — a living symbol of your commitment and self-discipline. The more consistent you are, the more your forest flourishes.

Habitree combines four powerful pillars:
- Gamification: Habit tracking is transformed into a fun and immersive experience.
- Productivity: Designed to help users build sustainable daily routines.
- Visual Progress: See your efforts take shape through dynamic and rewarding visuals.
- Sustainability Metaphor: Growing trees serves as a reminder of our connection with nature and the long-term value of our daily actions.

Key features include:
- Custom habit creation and tracking
- Beautiful animated trees that evolve with your progress
- Streak management and visual feedback
- Lightweight, responsive design built natively with SwiftUI

Whether you’re trying to build a new routine, stay productive, or simply make your days more meaningful, Habitree helps you stay on track — and watch your consistency grow.
